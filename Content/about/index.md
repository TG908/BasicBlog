I am Tim. I study computer science at the Department of Informatics at the Technical University of Munich. At the moment I am working on a practical comparison of full linear equalaites vs. two-variable linear eqularties as invariants in llvm IR for my bachelors thesis.
My main interests are compilers, programming languages and software engineering. I currently work as a iOS software engineer at Freeletics.
